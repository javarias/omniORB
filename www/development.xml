<p>
omniORB development happens in Subversion. See the omniORB <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/omniorb/">SourceForge
project page</a> for generic instructions, or <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/p/omniorb/svn/">browse</a>
the repository.
</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>
The repository contains the following directories:

<li><a
href="https://sourceforge.net/p/omniorb/svn/HEAD/tree/branches/">branches</a>
contains stable branches of omniORB. omniORB and omniORBpy releases
are synchronised with each other, so the branches are named after the
omniORB release.
</li>

<li>
<a
href="https://sourceforge.net/p/omniorb/svn/HEAD/tree/branches/4_3">branches/4_3</a>
is the current development branch, containing omniORB and omniORBpy 4.3.x.
</li>

<li>
<a
href="https://sourceforge.net/p/omniorb/svn/HEAD/tree/branches/4_2">branches/4_2</a>
is the current stable branch, containing omniORB and omniORBpy 4.2.x.
</li>

<li><a
href="https://sourceforge.net/p/omniorb/svn/HEAD/tree/tags/">tags</a>
contains tagged releases.
</li>

<li>
<a
href="https://sourceforge.net/p/omniorb/svn/HEAD/tree/cost/">cost</a>
contains testing code from the CORBA Open Source Testing project.
</li>

<ul>
<li><a
href="https://sourceforge.net/p/omniorb/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/">trunk</a>
contains a very incomplete and unstable development version. Do not
use it.
</li>

<li>
old_* contain old branches and tags resulting from the conversion from
CVS.
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you want the latest cut from Subversion without doing a checkout,
you can download nightly snapshots of the main branches from <a
href="snapshots/">this page</a>.
</p>


<h2>Building</h2>

<p>
Checkouts are built in the same way as a release. Note that to build
omniORBpy on Windows or other platforms using the traditional build
system, you must checkout the <code>omniORBpy</code> package within
the <code>src/lib</code> directory of an omniORB tree. With the
autoconf build on Unix platforms, it can be checked out anywhere.
