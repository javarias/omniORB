  Revision 1.6  2000/07/13 15:25:55  dpg1
  Merge from omni3_develop for 3.0 release.

  Revision 1.3.6.2  1999/09/24 15:01:37  djr
  Added module initialisers, and sll's new scavenger implementation.

  Revision 1.3.2.1  1999/09/21 20:37:17  sll
  -Simplified the scavenger code and the mechanism in which connections
   are shutdown. Now only one scavenger thread scans both incoming
   and outgoing connections. A separate thread do the actual shutdown.
  -omniORB::scanGranularity() now takes only one argument as there is
   only one scan period parameter instead of 2.
  -Trace messages in various modules have been updated to use the logger
   class.
  -ORBscanGranularity replaces -ORBscanOutgoingPeriod and
                                 -ORBscanIncomingPeriod.

  Revision 1.3  1999/08/30 16:47:46  sll
  New member functions.

  Revision 1.2  1999/03/11 16:25:56  djr
  Updated copyright notice

  Revision 1.1  1997/12/09 18:43:14  sll
