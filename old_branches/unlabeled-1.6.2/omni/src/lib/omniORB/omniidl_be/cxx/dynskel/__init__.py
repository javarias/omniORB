# Description:
#
#   Entrypoint to dynamic skeleton generation code

# $Id$
# $Log$
# Revision 1.6  2000/01/20 18:26:43  djs
# Moved large C++ output strings into an external template file
#
# Revision 1.5  2000/01/17 17:06:30  djs
# Added tcParser #ifdefs for bounded strings
#
# Revision 1.4  2000/01/13 15:56:34  djs
# Factored out private identifier prefix rather than hard coding it all through
# the code.
#
# Revision 1.3  2000/01/12 11:52:09  djs
# Added important comment :)
#
# Revision 1.2  1999/12/09 20:40:13  djs
# TypeCode and Any generation option performs identically to old compiler for
# all current test fragments.
#
# Revision 1.1  1999/11/12 17:18:06  djs
# Skeleton of dynamic skeleton code :)
#

# All you really need to know for the moment is that the universe
# is a lot more complicated than you might think, even if you
# start from a position of thinking it's pretty damn complicated
# in the first place.       Douglas Adams, "Mostly Harmless"
