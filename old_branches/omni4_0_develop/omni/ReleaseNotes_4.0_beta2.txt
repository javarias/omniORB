Known issues
------------

This beta is almost feature complete, but it has the following known
issues and omissions.

These issues should be fixed/resolved before the full 4.0.0 release:

 - Thread and mutex tracing is turned on by default, which has a
   serious performance impact. If you are doing performance testing,
   turn it off with the --disable-thread-tracing argument to
   configure, or by editing include/omniconfig.h. Otherwise, please
   leave it turned on, since it will help track down any threading
   bugs in omniORB. Tracing will be turned off by default in the 4.0.0
   release.

 - If the SSL transport is linked in to the application but is not
   initialised, ORB_init() fails.

 - When using SSL, ORB shutdown hangs if the ORB does not have a valid
   client certificate to connect to itself.

 - If a client has the offerBiDirectionalGIOP parameter set true, but
   it has not created a bidirectional POA, an exception is thrown on
   the first call.


These issues may not be resolved before the 4.0.0 release, but will be
fixed by 4.0.1.

 - Some interceptors are not implemented yet.

 - The thread wrapper mechanism from omniORB 3.0, allowing the
   application to wrap thread creation has not yet been
   reimplemented.

 - The planned per-thread call timeout is not implemented.

 - iostream insertion and extraction operators for CORBA types are not
   implemented.

 - Optional locking of proxy object factories, to enable dynamic
   loading/unloading of stubs is not implemented.
