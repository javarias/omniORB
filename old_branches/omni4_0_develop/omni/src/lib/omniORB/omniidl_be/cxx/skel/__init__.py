# Description:
#
#   Entrypoint to skeleton generation code

# $Id$
# $Log$
# Revision 1.8  2000/07/13 15:25:59  dpg1
# Merge from omni3_develop for 3.0 release.
#
# Revision 1.5.2.4  2000/06/26 16:24:16  djs
# Refactoring of configuration state mechanism.
#
# Revision 1.5.2.3  2000/05/31 18:03:38  djs
# Better output indenting (and preprocessor directives now correctly output at
# the beginning of lines)
# Calling an exception "e" resulted in a name clash (and resultant C++
# compile failure)
#
# Revision 1.5.2.2  2000/03/20 11:50:25  djs
# Removed excess buffering- output templates have code attached which is
# lazily evaluated when required.
#
# Revision 1.5.2.1  2000/02/14 18:34:54  dpg1
# New omniidl merged in.
#
# Revision 1.5  2000/01/13 15:56:43  djs
# Factored out private identifier prefix rather than hard coding it all through
# the code.
#
# Revision 1.4  2000/01/13 14:16:34  djs
# Properly clears state between processing separate IDL input files
#
# Revision 1.3  2000/01/11 11:34:49  djs
# Added support for fragment generation (-F) mode
#
# Revision 1.2  1999/11/19 20:10:13  djs
# Now runs the poa generating code after the main code
#
# Revision 1.1  1999/11/12 17:18:57  djs
# Struct skeleton code added
