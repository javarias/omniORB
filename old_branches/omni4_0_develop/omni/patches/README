This directory contains patches to the source to work around bugs in some
old compilers.

These patches are against omniORB 3.0, so they will not work with
omniORB 4.0. They should give you a hint about what needs to be done
to omniORB 4.0, though. If you successfully compile omniORB on one of
these platforms, please send an up to date patch to the omniORB
mailing list.

The patches are:

  dec_CXX_5.6.patch  - patch to apply to work around bugs in Dec C++ 5.6.
  aix_xlC_5.0.patch  - patch to work around problems with VisualAge C++ 5.0.
