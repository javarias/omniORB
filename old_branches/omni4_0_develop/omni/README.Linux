The platform file is i586_linux_2.0_glibc.mk for glibc-2.x based system
which include all the latest versions of linux distributions.

omniORB2 has been tested with

- 2.0 and 2.2 kernels
- glibc-2.0 and glibc-2.1 C library
- x86 egcs-1.1.2, gcc-2.95 or cygnus codefusion compiler

It has also been reported that omniORB2 also works on Powerpc linux in the
Debian distribution.

With omniORB 2.7.1, it can be compiled with the older gcc 2.7.2.1 and
libc-5 library. Some work is needed with omniORB 2.8.0 to get it to compile
with gcc 2.7.2 because not all the workarounds to the compiler bugs are in
place. The platform file is i586_linux_2.0.mk for this combination.

The gcc compiler, either egcs-1.1.2 or gcc-2.95, must be configured with
--enable-threads. This is necessary or else C++ exception handling will not
be thread safe. Not all linux distributions, if they ship with egcs-1.1.2
or gcc-2.95, come with the compiler configured with --enable-threads.

*** Before you build anything, you should edit i586_linux_2.0_glibc.mk to
    change the make variables CC and CXX to point to the right compiler.


Redhat 5.2
----------

Must fetch and build you own egcs-1.1.2 or gcc-2.95 compiler.

Redhat 6.0
----------

Comes with egcs-1.1.2 (with --enable-threads)

Suse 6.1
--------

Comes with egcs-1.1.2 without the --enable-threads configuration. This
compiler cannot be used to compile omniORB programs.

Debain
------

Make sure you have the right compiler package.
