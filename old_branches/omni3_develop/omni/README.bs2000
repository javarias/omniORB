         omniORB3 for Fujitsu Siemens BS2000 mainframes
         ==============================================

Thanks to Start Amadeus GmbH and Traventec, omniORB 3 has been ported
to Fujitsu Siemens BS2000. The changes are rather intrusive to the
source, so they are distributed as a patch. Apply the patch in
patches/BS2000.patch, then read the README.BS2000 file.
