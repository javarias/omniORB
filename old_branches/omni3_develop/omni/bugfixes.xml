  <summary>Thread tracing accidentally left on</summary>
  <text>
  <p>Tracing of mutexes and condition variables was accidentally left
  turned on in include/omniORB3/tracedthread.h. Turning it off gives a
  significant performance improvement, especially for local calls.</p>

  <p>All omniORB libraries need to be rebuilt to make this change; the
  make rules should do this automatically. The libraries remain
  compatible with user code, so it does not need to be recompiled. If
  you have omniORBpy installed, you must also recompile that.
  Unfortunately, its make rules do not realise that a recompile is
  necessary (I don't know why), so you must explicitly "<code>make
  clean</code>" before "<code>make export</code>".

  <summary>omniidl name look-up is more strict</summary>
  <text>
  When looking-up a name, omniidl now raises an error if a name which
  differs only in case is found along the look-up path. Before, it
  would ignore the name and continue until an exact match was found.

  <summary>OpenVMS patches from Bruce Visscher</summary>

  tools for building shareable images on the VAX platform. Also, some
  minor problems with the build of omniORBpy were fixed.</p>

  <p><em>Note:</em> This update is only available through CVS or the
