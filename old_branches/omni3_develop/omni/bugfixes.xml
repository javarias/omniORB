  <summary>Bug when assigning a String_var to itself</summary>
  <reported>Stefan Engelhardt</reported>
  <text>
  Assigning a String_var to itself would incorrectly delete the string
  contents.

  <summary>omniidl/C++ bug with unions with implicit default members</summary>
  <reported>Chris Newbold</reported>
  <link href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/archives/2000-09/0054.html"/>
  <text>
  The generated <code>_d(...)</code> method was incomplete, preventing
  the discriminant from being changed within the set of legal default
  values after calling <code>_default()</code> on a union with an implicit
  default member.

  <summary>omniidl produces no useful output on Windows 98</summary>
  <reported>Guangyu Gu, Mark Pumar, others</reported>
  <text>
  On some Windows 98 machines, but not others, the C pre-processor
  output is echoed to the screen, rather than forming the input to
  omniidl. omniidl therefore fails to generate any code. This fix adds
  a <code>-T</code> option to omniidl, which uses a temporary file
  rather than a pipe between the pre-processor and omniidl. It is
  reported that this works on affected Win98 machines.

<bug id="8" date="Wed Sep  6 12:13:30 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>Support for Python 1.6 and 2.0b1</summary>
  <text>
  omniidl was hard-coded to require Python 1.5.2, just in case later
  versions were incompatible. 1.6 and 2.0b1 are compatible, so they
  are now supported.

<bug id="7" date="Mon Sep  4 10:02:41 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>#includes of iostream.h left in omniORB headers</summary>
  <reported>Paul Nader</reported>
  <text>
  Several files had <code>#include&lt;iostream.h&gt;</code> left
  behind from debugging. This causes problems for code which does
  <code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code> without the <code>.h</code>.
  </text>

<bug id="6" date="Wed Aug 30 10:43:34 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>BOA constructor with object key broken</summary>
  <reported>Paul Nader</reported>
  <text>
  The fix to <a href="bug300.html#bug8">bug 8</a> in omniORB 3.0.0 did
  not actually work.
  </text>
</bug>

<bug id="5" date="Fri Aug 25 14:25:20 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>omniidl loses all but the first comment with -K</summary>
  <reported>Richard Gruet</reported>
  <text>
  On some platforms, omniidl -K would lose all but the first comment
  attached to a node. The code used a construct whose evaluation order
  is undefined in C++, so it worked with some compilers, but not
  others.
  </text>

<bug id="4" date="Wed Aug 23 16:44:36 BST 2000" user="djs">

  <summary>MSVC5/6 marshalling multidimensional arrays of basic types</summary>
  <reported>dme</reported>
  <text>MSVC5/6 fail to resolve the correct operator[] when marshalling
        a multidimensional array of basic types, only in the return case
        (not when using an out type)
  </text>
</bug>

<bug id="3" date="Tue Aug 22 15:48:11 BST 2000" user="sll">

  <summary>"Unexpected" exception at initialization</summary>
  <reported>Chris Newbold</reported>
  <link href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/archives/2000-08/0066.html"/>
  <text>When the port specified via -ORBpoa_iiop_port happens to be in use,
        an internal omniORB exception is raised by resolve_initial_reference().
        Now a system exception CORBA::INITIALIZE is raised instead.

<bug id="2" date="Tue Aug 22 10:59:21 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>Missing make rules for GCC on Solaris</summary>
  <reported>Mark Borges</reported>
  <link href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/archives/2000-08/0170.html"/>
  <text>Make rules for the omniDynamic shared library were missing, so
  the new libCOS failed to link.</text>
</bug>


<bug id="1" date="Mon Aug 21 10:11:51 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>Typo in omniidl.idltype.Declared.name()</summary>

  <reported>Richard Gruet</reported>

  <text>
  The <code>name()</code> function of <code>idltype.Declared</code>
  accidentally returned a list containing a single string rather than
  just the string itself.
  </text>
