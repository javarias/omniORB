  <summary>Incorrect TypeCode for union with multiple case
  labels</summary>
  <reported>Clemens Fischer</reported>
  <text>
  The generated TypeCode for a union with multiple case labels would
  have the wrong member count. e.g. the count for
  <p/>
  <pre>
  union U switch (long) {
    case 1:
    case 2: long l;
    case 3: string s;
  };
  </pre>
  would be 2 instead of 3.

  <summary>Incorrect DynSK stubs for some recursive types</summary>

  <text>
  The IDL compiler C++ back-end would generate incorrect TypeCode
  constants for IDL like <p/>
  <pre>
    struct S {
      sequence &lt;sequence &lt;S&gt; &gt; a;
    };
  </pre>

  <summary>Memory corruption when initialising multiply-recursive
  structures</summary>
  <reported>Marcus Bullingham</reported>

  href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/archives/2001-02/0259.html"/>
  <text>
  IDL types where there was more than one recursion to the same type
  would corrupt memory, sometimes leading to a crash.
