Release Notes for omniORB 3.0.0 pre1  (27th September 1999)
====================================

The last release was 2.8.0 (31st August 1999).

Source code is available via anonymous CVS.  Please see:

Introduction
------------

This version of omniORB incorporates a major re-write of the core runtime.
Key features include:

  o  support for the Portable Object Adapter (POA)
  o  identical semantics for local and remote object invocations
  o  location forwarding into and outof the local address space
  o  new dynamically growing object table (improves performance
      for applications with large numbers of objects)
  o  legacy support for the BOA (including using both BOA and POA
      together in the same process)
  o  improved message logging, including logging application
      level requests
  o  lots of other stuff

In theory I have merged all of the updates in the 2.8.0 release, and
will continue to keep up-to-date with that.

By default the shared runtime libraries are built with debugging
information and no optimisation.  This is because I want you to find
bugs!  The overhead is really not very great.  If you really need to
build optimised libraries, then you need to take a number of steps to
disable debug info:

  o  comment out  '#define OMNIORB_ENABLE_LOCK_TRACES'  in
      include/omniORB3/tracedthread.h
  o  dissable the OMNIORB_ASSERT() macro in
      include/omniORB3/omniInternal.h
  o  do  'export subdir_makeflags="CXXDEBUGFLAGS=-O2"'  at
      the command line before rebuilding all libraries and
      applications.

Note that if you don't rebuild all the libraries and applications after
disabling the lock tracing code, you will certainly crash at some point.
Please be very careful not to do this (I don't want it reported as a
bug!).

Please test it extensively!


Changes since 2.8.0
-------------------

1. The POA.

   Exists!

   The following features are not implemented:

     o  PortableServer::Current
     o  DSI is incomplete (depends on Current).


2. IDL stubs.

   There are a number of improvements.  You may find that the size of the
   stub code generated is smaller.

   The stubs must be regenerated with the new IDL compiler to be compatible
   with the runtime library.

   The current shared runtime library versions are:

   On various unices:

       libomniORB3.so ---> libomniORB3.so.0 --> libomniORB3.so.0.0

   On IBM AIX

       libomniORB30.a
       libomniDynamic30.a

   On Windows NT/95, the omniORB runtime DLLs for this version are:

       libomniORB300_rt.dll
       libomniORB300_rt.lib
       libomniDynamic300_rt.dll
       libomniDynamic300_rt.lib

   Make sure you update your Visual Studio to pick up the right library.


3. New command line options and ORB configuration variables:

    -ORBtraceInvocations
    omniORB::traceInvocations
      enable tracing of invocations of CORBA objects.

    -ORBpoa_iiop_port <port number>
      tells the POA the port number to use.

    -ORBpoa_iiop_name_port <hostname[:port number]>
      tells the POA the hostname and optionally the port number to use.

      NB. The BOA and POA will both use the same port if used together.

    omniORB::objectTableSize

      The default value is zero, and indicates that omniORB should grow
      the object table as necassary.  It is recommended that you use
      this facility.

      Setting another value sets a fixed size for the object table,
      thus eliminating the overhead of resizing the table if you
      know in advance the likely number of objects.  Since an open
      hsah table is used, performance does not suffer disasterously
      if this number of objects is exceeded.

      If set, this value must be modified before calling CORBA::ORB_init().

    omniORB::poaHoldRequestTimeout

      If a POA is in the HOLDING state, then this value gives the number
      of seconds after which the POA will timeout and throw a TRANSIENT
      exception to the client (if the POA is not transitioned to
      another state).

      The default is zero, which indicates no timeout.


4. New mapping for signatures of operations in skeletons.

    The mapping for the arguments to operations in implementation
    skeletons changed in the spec between versions 2.1 and 2.2.
    You are now required to use T_out types (where applicable) for
    'out' arguments.

    This may mean that you have to modify your object implementations.
    However the old signatures can still be used by passing the
    -Bold_signatures flag to omniidl3.


5. New omniidl3 flags:

    -t has been replaced by two new options:

      -tp              - produce tie implementation skeletons
      -tf              - generate flattened tie implementation skeletons

    The latter is needed if on your platform modules are mapped to
    c++ classes, and your compiler does not support template members
    of classes.

    -Bboa              - generate BOA skeletons (_sk_foo).  By default
                         only POA skeletons are generated.

    To generate the old-style (BOA compatible) tie skeletons you
    must supply both the -b and -tf flags.

    -Bold_signatures   - use pre CORBA 2.2 mapping for skeleton operation
                         signatures.


6. The member function CORBA::ORB::NP_destroy() is deprecated.  Use
   CORBA::ORB::destroy() instead.


7. Location Forwarding.

    A new omniORB specific exception omniORB::LOCATION_FORWARD is
    included.  This may be thrown from an object implementation to
    indicate to the client that the request should be re-directed
    to another object.

    For portability you are better off using
    PortableServer::ForwardRequest within a ServantManager.
    However omniORB::LOCATION_FORWARD is more flexible, since it
    can be thrown from any object implementation.

    See include/omniORB3/omniORB.h


8. Examples.

    The standard echo examples have been updated to use the POA.
    There is a 'boa' directory which uses the old-style BOA interface.
    There is also a 'poa' directory which isn't very exciting yet,
    but will soon have a few more samples of POA code.


9. omniNames.

    This has been updated to use the POA.  Unfortunately the format of
    the log file has changed slightly.  Eventually we may write a utility
    to convert the log file to the new format.  But for now if this is a
    problem for you, then please continue to use an older version.


10. The omniORB user guide has *not* been updated :(


11. Things that don't work.

    a) The PortableServer::Current interface is not supported.  Any
       behaviour depending per-thread context information is not
       supported.

    b) The DSI interface has changed significantly.  Old code will
       have to be re-written to the new interface.  There is no
       support for using the DSI with the BOA.
        This part of the ORB is incomplete, since it depends in
       part on PortableServer::Current.  See the example in
       src/examples/dsi for a way to workaround this problem for
       now.

    c) The Lifecycle service has not yet been re-implemented.

    d) The name of tie implementation skeletons has changed (in line
       with the POA mapping).
