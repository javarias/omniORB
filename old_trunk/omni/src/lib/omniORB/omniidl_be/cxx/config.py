# Revision 1.5  1999/12/24 18:20:12  djs
# Builds list of IDL files #included by walking the AST and examining the
# file() of each Decl node.

#
# Revision 1.3  1999/11/12 17:17:45  djs
# Creates output files rather than using stdout
# Utility functions useful for skeleton generation added
#
# Revision 1.2  1999/11/10 20:19:30  djs
# Option to emulate scope bug in old backend
# Array struct element fix
# Union sequence element fix
