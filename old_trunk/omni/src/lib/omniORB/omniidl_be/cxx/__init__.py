# Description:
#
#   Entrypoint to the C++ backend

# $Id$
# $Log$
# Revision 1.9  1999/12/01 17:05:13  djs
# Backend now supports command line arguments
#
# Revision 1.8  1999/11/29 19:26:59  djs
# Code tidied and moved around. Some redundant code eliminated.
#
# Revision 1.7  1999/11/17 20:37:09  djs
# General util functions
#
# Revision 1.6  1999/11/15 19:10:54  djs
# Added module for utility functions specific to generating skeletons
# Union skeletons working
#
# Revision 1.5  1999/11/12 17:17:45  djs
# Creates output files rather than using stdout
# Utility functions useful for skeleton generation added
#
# Revision 1.4  1999/11/08 19:28:56  djs
# Rewrite of sequence template code
# Fixed lots of typedef problems
#
# Revision 1.3  1999/11/04 19:05:01  djs
# Finished moving code from tmp_omniidl. Regression tests ok.
#
# Revision 1.2  1999/11/03 17:35:06  djs
# Brought more of the old tmp_omniidl code into the new tree
#
# Revision 1.1  1999/11/03 11:09:49  djs
# General module renaming
#

# From http://www-i3.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/funny/babbage.html:

# C. A. R. Hoare, in his 1980 ACM Turing Award lecture, told of two
# ways of constructing a software design: "One way is to make it so
# simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way
# is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies."
