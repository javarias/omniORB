* Sort out where output is conditional on the host system. Most system
  specific stuff is output on all platforms within #ifdefs. Some appears
  not to be (look for o2be_global::mflag in original source)

* Fix handling of floats. Mainly aesthetic problem caused by lack of python
  float type. Floats in source appear with extra digits when output. Not
  an error, just a difference.

* Rewrite handling of names in Environment class. Seems clunky, inelegant
  and maybe prone to error

* Sort out functions declared as extern even though they are complete with
  chunks of code. (typedefs to arrays)

* Factor out generation of array-spanning loops into a reusable function

* Sort out argument passing conventions (pointer, reference etc etc)
  examine tables in old BE and look for exceptions etc
