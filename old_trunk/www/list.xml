There is a lively omniORB mailing list, where you can ask questions
about using omniORB, report bugs, and discuss CORBA usage in general.
To prevent spam, you must be a member of the list to post to it.
Please do not try to post to the list if you have not subscribed,
since it creates work for the list administrator.
