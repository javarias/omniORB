<p>
There is a lively omniORB mailing list, where you can ask questions
about using omniORB, report bugs, and discuss CORBA usage in general.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, with the closure of AT&amp;T Labs Cambridge, the list
hosting is in flux, so the list might not be working at the moment,
and you might not be able to subscribe. The situation will be resolved
in the very near future.
</p>

<p>
Until things are finalised, you can look at the <a
href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/intouch.html">old mailing
list page</a> for archives and details about subscribing.  Don't panic
if you try to subscribe and it doesn't work. Check back here in a few
days, and hopefully we will have sorted it out.
