<h2>Interface Repository</h2>

<p>The Interface Repository example has a simple AccountManager interface to create an
account and (re)open an account. At the initialization time the AccountManager
implementation bootstraps the Interface Repository definition for the managed Account
interface with purpose to expose to the clients the additional operation that has been
already implemented by this particular Account implementation. The clients now can access
all known (described in IDL) operations as they do this usually and, additionally, the can
verify with the Interface Repository the support for other operations and invoke them.
This example illistrates how we can manage the Interface Repository definition objects and
how we can do the remote object's introspection using the Interface Repository.</p>

From this example, you will learn how to: 

<ul>
  <li>Use Interface Repository API to manage its metadata in purpose to expose the object's
    extended functionality </li>
</ul>
