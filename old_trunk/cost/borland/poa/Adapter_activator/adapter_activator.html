<H2> Adapter Activator Bank </H2>
<p>This example has a simple AccountManager interface to open an Account and to 
  query the balance in that account. It sets an adapter activator on the root 
  POA, creates a POA hierarchy under root POA, activates a servant on the leaf 
  POA, writes out the reference and destroys the created POAs. The act of destroying 
  the POA will also deactivate the servant on that POA. The server then starts 
  waiting for requests. </p>
<p>When client makes a request, the server side ORB realizes that the POA on which 
  the request is made is no longer present. It then invokes adapter activator's 
  unknown_adapter method repeatedly until all the POA hierarchy is created. The 
  implementation of unknown_adapter also sets the adapter activator of the newly 
  created POA to be that of parent's adapter activator.Finally when the leaf POA 
  is created, the unknown_adapter activates the servant on that POA. With all 
  the POAs alive and the servant activated on the right POA, the request completes 
  and client gets the result.</p>
<p>If you invoke the client again, you will see from the server output that adapter 
  activators are <b>not</b> fired again. This is because the POAs created by adapter 
  activators will stay alive until explicitly destroyed.</p>

<BR>From this example, you will learn how to:

<UL>
  <LI> To create an adapter activator and create a POA in its unknown_adapter 
    method. </LI>
  <LI>To set adapter activator on a POA</LI>
  <LI> To ensure an entire POA hierarchy gets created in unknown_adapter by setting 
    the adapter activator of each new POA. </LI>
</UL>
