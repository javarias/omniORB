<BR>IDL interface for the <B>MyPOAManager</B> and <B>Counter.</B>
<LI>
<A HREF="Server.C">Server.C</A></LI>

<LI>
The server. Creates a POA named "counter_poa" for the <B>Counter </B>servant
and a POA named "my_poa_manager_poa" for the <B>MyPOAManager</B> servant.
Activates the 2 servants with id "Counter" and "MyPOAManager" respectively.
Finally, it activates the poa managers for the "counter_poa" and "my_poa_manager_poa"
and starts waiting for client requests. Both poa's starts with active
state.  Server.C also contains the  <B>Counter</B> servant implementation.
Implements the method nextId() that returns the id of the request, starting with the first request's id being zero.

Server.C also includes the <B>MyPOAManager</B> servant Implementation. The server passes the poa manager of "counter_poa" to the constructor when creating this
servant.&nbsp; All operations on <B>MyPOAManager</B> are directly passed
onto the actual poa manager of "counter_poa".&nbsp; These operations are
activate(), hold_requests(), discard_requests(), deactivate() and get_state().
<LI>
<A HREF="Client.C">Client.C</A></LI>

<BR>The client. It sets the proper client side policy and binds to the
<B>Counter</B> object using the id "Counter".&nbsp; It then enters an infinite
loop that keeps invoking nextId() on the <B>Counter </B>object.&nbsp; Anytime
an exception is caught, a message indicating the type of exception will
be printed.
<LI>
<A HREF="Manager.C">Manager.C</A></LI>

<BR>The third party that controls the flow of requests on the <B>Counter
</B>object.&nbsp; It binds to <B>MyPOAManager </B>object using the id "MyPOAManager"
and keeps prompting for user input.&nbsp; The choices given to users are
the 5 operations on a POA manager.

<H3>
Building this example</H3>
Typing <B>make cpp</B> (or <B>nmake cpp</B> <I>on Windows</I>) in the manager
subdirectory will cause the <A HREF="Demo.idl">Demo.idl</A> to be run through
the idl2cpp compiler. It will also build the following executables for the
examples described above:
<UL>
<LI>
Server</LI>

<LI>
Client</LI>

<LI>
Manager</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Running this example</H3>
To run the examples, first make sure that the VisiBroker Smart Agent (osagent
executable) is running on your network. Then start the server using the
command:
<UL>
<PRE><TT><B>prompt></B> Server&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp;
(start Server <I>on Windows</I>)
<I>// make the server run in the background</I></TT></PRE>
</UL>
Next, starts the client and observe the output on the client side:
<UL>
<PRE><I><TT><B>prompt></B> Client</TT></I></PRE>
</UL>
Then, starts the manager and try to intervene the flow on request and observe
the output on the client side:
<UL>
<PRE><I><TT><B>prompt></B> Manager</TT></I></PRE>
</UL>
You will see that when put to holding state, the client side will stop
printing the request id.&nbsp; Once resume the active state, the client
side will resume the printing of the request id.&nbsp; When put to the
discarding state, <B>TRANSIENT </B>exception will be caught on the client
side.&nbsp; Lastly, exception <B>OBJ_ADAPTER </B>will be caught on the
client side once the manager sets the state to inactive.&nbsp; The client
side will catch <B>OBJ_ADAPTER </B>everytime a request is made on the <B>Counter
</B>and the state is permanent.
