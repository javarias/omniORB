Manager Example</H2>
The example has 2 interfaces.&nbsp; <B>MyPOAManager</B> is used to simulate
the behavior of a POA manager by implementing all the operations of the
POA manager and direct the calls to the actual POA manager.&nbsp; <B>Counter
</B>is a dummy object which keeps incrementing the number of times this
object a request has been invoked on this object.

<P>This example involves 3 parties, the server that creates the poas for
the <B>MyPOAManager</B> and <B>Counter</B> objects, the client that repeatedly
invokes the <B>Counter </B>object, and the manager that acts as the third
party that controls the flow of the requests made on <B>Counter</B> by
client.

<P>The purpose of the example is to show how requests on objects associated
with a poa can be kept in holding, active, discarding and inactivate states.&nbsp;
The user can randomly stop the flow of request on a particular object by
putting the poa manager of the poa associated with that object in holding
state.&nbsp; It can also resume the flow by putting it in active state.&nbsp;
Under discarding state, all requests on the object will be discarded and
client will receive a <B>TRANSIENT</B> exception when appropriate client
side policies are adopted.&nbsp; Requests will be resumed once the state
is set to active.&nbsp; Similarly, under inactive state, all requests will
be rejected and client will receive an <B>OBJ_ADAPTER</B> exception.&nbsp;
The inactive state is permanent once entered.

<P>Note: Client must set the appropriate client side policies in order
to receive the <B>TRANSIENT</B> exception when requests are discarded.

Go from one poa state to another.</LI>

Control the flow of client request by discarding requests when overflooded.</LI>
