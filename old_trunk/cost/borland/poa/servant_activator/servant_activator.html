<H2> Bank Servant Activator</H2>
<p>This example has two simple interfaces - SavingsAccountManager and CheckingAccountManager
  to open the appropriate Account and to query the balance in that account.
  Instead of creating the servants and waiting for requests, 
  this example manufactures two object references, one for SavingsAccountManager and another 
  for CheckingAccountManager and writes it out to files &quot;cref.dat&quot;
  and &quot;sref.dat&quot; and starts waiting for requests.
  Example sets up a servant activator on the POA. The servant is created
  only when the first request is made. Future requests go through 
  the already created servant as long as the servant stays in memory.</p>
<p>Once the servant is created, the example also kicks of a background thread 
  that deactivates the servant after 15 seconds. This deactivate will cause the 
  servant activator's etherealize to be invoked giving the servant an opportunity 
  to store its state if necessary. The next request coming after this point will 
  again go through the servant activator's incarnate and activates the servant.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This scenario of activating the servants only on demand is very useful in Servers 
  which serve a large number of objects. Object references for these large number 
  of objects can be manufactured and advertised without bringing the corresponding 
  servants to life. When a request comes on a particular object reference, POA 
  realizes that the servant is not in memory, invokes the servant activator set 
  for that POA which can load the object state from a database and bring the object 
  to life. The server can also run a background thread to deactivate servants 
  after a period of inactivity.</p>
