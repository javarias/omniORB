<a href="Server.java">Server.java</a></li>

<br>The Bank server, modified for the RebindPolicy test. It creates a POA
named rebind_agent_poa, creates an instance of the <b>AccountManager</b>
servant, activates the servant on rebind_agent_poa and obtains the object
reference for the servant.&nbsp; It then activates the poa manager and
starts waiting for client requests.
<li>
<a href="ForwardServer.java">ForwardServer.java</a></li>

<br>An alternate implementation of the Bank server, which creates a Servant
Locator which will throw a ForwardException on every second request, resulting
in a reply with status LOCATION_FORWARD. This is used in the second scenario
to show how the different settings of the RebindPolicy control the reaction
of the client-side ORB to this type of Reply.
<li>
<a href="AccountImpl.java">AccountImpl.java</a></li>

<br>Account servant implementation. Implements the balance() method.
<li>
<a href="AccountManagerImpl.java">AccountManagerImpl.java</a></li>

<br>Account Manager servant Implementation. Implements open() method. Uses
a static table to see if there is already an <b>Account</b> for the specified
user. If not, creates an account with random balance. This newly created
account of type <b>AccountImpl</b>&nbsp; is the servant of the account
object.&nbsp; This account servant is also implicitly activated by bank_implicit_activation_poa
when creating the account object reference from the account servant.&nbsp;
Returns the created account.
<li>
<a href="AccountManagerLocator.java">AccountManagerLocator.java</a></li>

<br>AccountManager servant locator, used by ForwardServer.java.
<li>
<a href="Client.java">Client.java</a></li>

<br>This is the Bank client. It binds to the <b>AccountManager</b> object
and invokes <tt>open()</tt> to open a bank account. It then invokes <tt>balance()</tt>
on the <b>Account</b> object reference obtained to query the balance. The
client sets the RebindPolicy to the value specified on the command line.
The client attempts to invoke the AccountManager, waits for the user to
press return, and then invokes a second time.

<h3>
Building this example</h3>
Typing <b>make</b> -f Makefile.java (or <b>nmake -f Makefile.java</b> <i>on
Windows</i>) in the qos subdirectory will cause the <a href="Bank.idl">Bank.idl</a>
to be run through the idl2java compiler.It will also build the class files
for the examples described above.
<h3>
Running the examples</h3>
To run the examples, first make sure that the VisiBroker Smart Agent (osagent
executable) is running on your network.
<h4>
Starting the server</h4>
There are 3 scenarios used in this example to demonstrate the behavior
of the client-side ORB in the presence of the following three events.&nbsp;
It is controlled by the six incarnations of the Rebind policy. For every
scenario, you need a different setup on the server-side.
<p><b>Handling of closed connections&nbsp;</b> The server object sends
a GIOP CloseConnection message to the client. This may happen when a server
receives a high number of new connections and closes the least recently
used one to process them. To simulate this situation, we allow the server
to have only one open connection at a time, and start a second client,
which will cause the connection to the first client being dropped.
<p><tt><b>prompt></b> vbj -Dvbroker.se.iiop_tp.scm.iiop_tp.manager.connectionMax=1
Server
&amp;</tt>
<br><tt>start vbj -Dvbroker.se.iiop_tp.scm.iiop_tp.manager.connectionMax=1
Server
<i>(on
Windows</i>)</tt>
<br><i><tt>// make the server run in the background</tt></i>
<p>Start the first client with the policy value you want to test as the
command line option, e.g. for the OMG NO_RECONNECT value:
<br><tt><b>prompt> </b>vbj Client no_reconnect</tt>
<p>The client program will print out the balance on the default account
and wait for you to press return. Start a second client in another window.
It will print the balance and, as a side-effect, the server will send a
GIOP CloseConnection message to the first client.&nbsp; Now hit enter on
the first client and observe the behavior. The NO_RECONNECT policy value
will raise a REBIND exceptions, whereas all other policies will allow the
client ORB to silently reconnect to the server again.
<p><b>Handling of message forwarding</b>&nbsp; The server object sends
a reply message to the client which contains the status LOCATION_FORWARD.&nbsp;
The reply includes an IOR that refers to the object that the client should
forward the original message to. To test the behavior of the client ORB
in this case, you need to start the server as below:<b></b>
<p><tt><b>prompt></b> vbj ForwardServer &amp;</tt>
<br><tt>start vbj ForwardServer
(<i>on Windows</i>)</tt>
<br><i><tt>// make the server run in the background</tt></i>
<p>Start the client with the policy value you want to test as the command
line option, e.g. for the VB_NO_REBIND value:
<br>&nbsp;<tt><b>prompt> </b>vbj Client vb_no_rebind</tt><b></b>
<p><b>Handling of object failover&nbsp;</b> If the client encounters a
communication problem with a peer object, that is probably caused by the
termination of the server, the client ORB will try to use another object
that provides the same interface, if the setting of the RebindPolicy allows
for it.
<br><tt><b>prompt></b> vbj 
Server &amp;</tt>
<br><tt>start vbj
Server
<i>(on Windows</i>)</tt>
<br><i><tt>// make the server run in the background</tt></i>
<p>Start the first client with the policy value you want to test as the
command line option, e.g. for the OMG NO_RECONNECT value:
<br><tt><b>prompt> </b>vbj Client vb_transparent</tt><tt></tt>
<p>While the client waits for you to press return, terminate, and restart
the server. Fail-over will be disabled or enabled, depending on your choice
of the RebindPolicy policy value.
<br>&nbsp;

has.

<b><tt></tt></b>
<p>After you started the server accordingly for one of the aspects you
want to test, here is how you invoke the client.
<pre><b><tt>prompt></tt></b>vbj <tt>Client transparent</tt></pre>
This policy value allows automatic handling of forward messages to a new
server, regardless of whether the effective policies for the new change.
It also will open new and reopen closed GIOP connections to server objects.
<pre><b><tt>prompt></tt></b>vbj <tt>Client no_rebind</tt></pre>
This policy value allows the ORB to open new and reopen closed GIOP connections
to server objects, and allows automatic handling of forward messages, if
the effective policies for the new connection would be the same as with
the current connection.
<pre><b><tt>prompt></tt></b>vbj <tt>Client no_reconnect</tt></pre>
This policy value disallows the client ORB to reopen closed GIOP connections
to the same object, as well as all message forwards.
<pre><b><tt>prompt></tt></b>vbj <tt>Client vb_transparent</tt></pre>
This policy value extends the transparent RebindPolicy value as defined
by the OMG (as explained above) to handle sobject fail-over. If this policy
value is in effect, and a broken connection is detected, the Smart Agent
is contacted for a new server. If there is one, then the request will be
issued, without an exception being thrown. This policy value is useful
if the objects don't maintain state, and a fail-over to another object
doesn't influence the result of the invocation.
<pre><b><tt>prompt></tt></b>vbj <tt>Client vb_notify_rebind</tt></pre>
This policy value is like vb_transparent, but when a server shutdown is
detected, the appropriate exception is thrown, and a rebind attempt will
be made if the invocation is retried. This policy is useful for statefull
servers, because a transparent fail-over could lead to problems.
<pre><b><tt>prompt></tt></b>vbj <tt>Client vb_no_rebind</tt></pre>
This policy value allows reconnections to the same object, but no rebind
(either through LOCATION_FORWARD or fail-over) to other servers.
