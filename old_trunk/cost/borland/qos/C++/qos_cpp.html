  Bank server. This file contains the server, implementations of Account servant and
  Account Manager servant. The Account servant implements <TT>balance()</TT>. The Account
  Manager servant implements <TT>open()</TT> which checks in a table to see if there is
  already an <b>Account</b> for the specified user. If not, it creates an account with random
  balance and returns the created account. Creates a POA named MyPOA, creates an instance of
  the <B>AccountManager</B> servant and activates that servant on the MyPOA. It then starts
  waiting for client requests.
  <LI> <A HREF="Client.C">Client.C</A></LI>
  <BR>
  This is the Bank client. It binds to the <B>AccountManager</B> object and invokes
  <TT>open()</TT> to open a bank account. It then invokes <TT>balance()</TT> on
  the <B>Account</B> object reference obtained to query the balance.
  The Bank client for QoS in addition also sets one policy. This policy affects
  the rebind behavior of the orb.  By default, the orb will attempt rebinds
  and reconnects transparently (without user intervention) when the orb detects
  that the connection has be disrupted. By setting the Rebind policy you can
  change the behavior the orb will take when this detection is made.

<H3>
Building this example</H3>
Typing <B>make</B> -f Makefile.cpp (or <B>nmake -f Makefile.cpp</B> <i>on Windows</i>) in the
bank_agent subdirectory will cause the <A HREF="Bank.idl">Bank.idl</A> to be run
through the idl2cpp compiler. It will also build the following executables for the
examples described above:
<UL>
  <LI> Server (Server.exe <i>on Windows</i>)</LI>
  <LI> Client (Client.exe <i>on Windows</i>)</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Running this example</H3>
To run the examples, first make sure that the VisiBroker Smart Agent (osagent
executable) is running on your network. Then start the bank server using the command:

<UL>
<PRE><TT><B>prompt></B> Server&nbsp; &amp;
(start Server <i>on Windows</i>)
<i>// make the server run in the background<i></i></i></TT></PRE>
</UL>

Next, like the standard Bank example, the client will open a user's
    bank account and query the balance in the account using the
    command.  At this time you will be prompted to stop the server and
    restart it again.  This causes the client's reference (BankManager
    instance) to be invalid. After you've restarted the server the
    client will attempt to open the user's account again and get a
    balance. Depending on the parameter described below you will see
    different behavior. 

<p>After you started the server accordingly for one of the aspects you
want to test, here is how you invoke the client.
<pre><b><tt>prompt></tt></b><tt>Client transparent</tt></pre>
This policy value allows automatic handling of forward messages to a new
server, regardless of whether the effective policies for the new change.
It also will open new and reopen closed GIOP connections to server objects.
<pre><b><tt>prompt></tt></b><tt>Client no_rebind</tt></pre>
This policy value allows the ORB to open new and reopen closed GIOP connections
to server objects, and allows automatic handling of forward messages, if
the effective policies for the new connection would be the same as with
the current connection.
<pre><b><tt>prompt></tt></b><tt>Client no_reconnect</tt></pre>
This policy value disallows the client ORB to reopen closed GIOP connections
to the same object, as well as all message forwards.
<pre><b><tt>prompt></tt></b><tt>Client vb_transparent</tt></pre>
This policy value extends the transparent RebindPolicy value as defined
by the OMG (as explained above) to handle object fail-over. If this policy
value is in effect, and a broken connection is detected, the Smart Agent
is contacted for a new server. If there is one, then the request will be
issued, without an exception being thrown. This policy value is useful
if the objects don't maintain state, and a fail-over to another object
doesn't influence the result of the invocation.
<pre><b><tt>prompt></tt></b><tt>Client vb_notify_rebind</tt></pre>
This policy value is like vb_transparent, but when a server shutdown is
detected, the appropriate exception is thrown, and a rebind attempt will
be made if the invocation is retried. This policy is useful for statefull
servers, because a transparent fail-over could lead to problems.
<pre><b><tt>prompt></tt></b><tt>Client vb_no_rebind</tt></pre>
This policy value allows reconnections to the same object, but no rebind
(either through LOCATION_FORWARD or fail-over) to other servers.
