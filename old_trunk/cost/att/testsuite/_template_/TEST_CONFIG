# This is a sample test configuration file
#
# The structure of this configuration file is rather simple -- one
# line per test case (comment lines begn with a '#'):
# <test name> <timeout> <server 1> <server 2> .. <client>
#
# <test name>: a string which identifies the test
# <timeout>: timeout in seconds for the test, the client program has to
#	     terminate within this time, otherwise the test fails
# <server 1> .. <server n>: server programs are started in the given order
# <client>: client program
#
"_template_ test 1" 5 server client
"_template_ test 2" 10 server client
