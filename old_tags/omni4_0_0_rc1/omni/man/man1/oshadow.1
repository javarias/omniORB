.SH NAME
oshadow \- create a shadow of a source tree
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B oshadow
.I [directory]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The oshadow command creates a directory structure in the current directory
identical to that below the given directory.  Essentially it is just like
.B lndir
but without the symbolic links.  If no directory is given on the command line
then one is prompted for.  If the current directory is the top of an OMNI build
tree created with
.B obuildtree,
the default directory to shadow will be the first source tree.
 
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR obuildtree (1)
.BR omake (1)
.BR lndir (1)

.SH FILES
.TP 5
.B ./config/sources
contains a list of the source trees if this is an OMNI build tree.
