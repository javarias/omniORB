.TH omake 1 "15.10.96" "ORL"
.SH NAME
omake \- run GNU make inside an OMNI build tree
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B omake
.I [variable=value]*
.I [target]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The omake command runs GNU make inside an OMNI build tree.  Arguments given to
.B omake
on the command line are passed directly on to
.B make,
but
.B omake
itself generates extra arguments, amongst which are:
.TP 5
.B TOP=<top>
This tells make the path from the current directory to the top of the build
tree.
.TP
.B CURRENT=<current>
This is the path from the top of the tree down to the current directory
.TP
.B VPATH=<directories>
This is a list of the source directories (the equivalent of the current
directory in each of the source trees).  Make will search through these
directories if it can't find a source file in the current directory.
.TP
.B -f <top>/config/config.mk
This tells make to use config.mk as the makefile.  In turn config.mk will
include other files from the import trees and will include dir.mk from either
the current directory or one of the source directories.
.TP
.B -I <source-directory>
These arguments tell make to search the source directories for the dir.mk file.
.TP
.B OMAKE_TARGET=<target>
This is set to the final argument given to omake (usually the target).
