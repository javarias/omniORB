<P>
Now that you are familiar with the basics, it is important to
familiar yourselves with the IDL to C++ language. The mapping is described
in detail in [<A HREF="node15.html#corba2spec">OMG99a</A>]. If you have not done so, you should obtain
a copy of the document and use that as the programming guide to
omniORB2.
<P>
The specification is not an easy read. The alternative is to use one of the
books on CORBA programming that has begun to appear. For instance, the
``Advanced CORBA Programming with C++'' by Michi Henning and Steve Vinoski
includes many example code bits to illustrate how to use the CORBA 2.3
C++ mapping.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION00410000000000000000> Incompatibilities with pre-2.8.0 releases</A></H1>
<P>
Before 2.8.0, omniORB2 implements the CORBA 2.0 C++ mapping. Since 2.8.0,
the mapping has been updated to CORBA 2.3. Unfortunately, to comply with
the CORBA 2.3 specification, it is necessary to change the semantics of
a few APIs in a way that is incompatible with older omniORB2 releases.
The incompatible changes are limited to:
<P>
<OL><LI> the extraction of string, object reference and typecode from an Any. 
<LI> the DII interface now defaults to report a system exception by
raising a C++ exception instead of returning the exception as an
environment value.
</OL>
<P>
The changes are minor and requires minimal changes to the application
source code. <b> However, it is not possible to detect the old usage at
compile time. In particular, unmodified code that use the affected Any
extraction operators would most certainly cause runtime errors to occur.</b>
<P>
To smooth the transition from the old usage to the new, an ORB configuration
variable <tt> omniORB::omniORB_27_CompatibleAnyExtraction</tt> can be set to
revert the any extraction operators to the old semantics. More information
can be found in chapter <A HREF="node10.html#ch_any">9</A>.
