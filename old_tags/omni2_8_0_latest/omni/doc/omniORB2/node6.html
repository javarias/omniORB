<P>

<P>
This chapter describes the BOA implementation in omniORB2. The CORBA
specification defines the Basic Object Adaptor as the entity that mediates
between object implementations and the ORB. Unfortunately, the BOA
specification is incomplete and does not address the multi-threading issues
appropriately. The end result is that different ORB vendors implement
different extensions to their BOAs. Worse, the implementation of the operations
defined in the specification are different in different ORBs. Recently, a new
Object Adaptor specification (the Portable Object Adaptor- POA) has been
adopted and will replace the BOA as the standard Object Adaptor in
CORBA. The new specification recognises the compatibility problems of BOA
and recommends that all BOAs should be considered propriety extensions.
OmniORB2 will support POA in future releases. Until then, you have to
use the BOA to attach object implementations to the ORB.
<P>
The rest of this chapter describes the interface of the BOA in detail. It
is important to recognise that the interface described below is omniORB2
specific and hence the code using this interface is unlikely to be portable
to other ORBs.
<P>
Unless it is stated otherwise, the term ``object'' will be used below to
refer to object implementations. This should not be confused with ``object
references'' which are handles held by clients.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION00610000000000000000> BOA Initialisation</A></H1>
<P>
It takes two steps to put the BOA into service. The BOA has to be
initialised using <tt> BOA_init</tt> and activated using <tt>
impl_is_ready</tt>.
<P>
 <tt> BOA_init</tt> is a member of the <tt> CORBA::ORB</tt> class. Its signature is:
<P>

<PRE>BOA_ptr BOA_init(int &amp; argc,
                 char ** argv,
                 const char * boa_identifier);
</PRE>

<P>
 Typically, it is used in the startup code as follows:
<P>

<PRE>CORBA::ORB_ptr orb = CORBA::ORB_init(argc,argv,&quot;omniORB2&quot;);   // line 1
CORBA::BOA_ptr boa = orb-&gt;BOA_init(argc,argv,&quot;omniORB2_BOA&quot;); // line 2
</PRE>

<P>
The <tt> argv</tt> parameters may contain BOA options. These options will be
removed from the <tt> argv</tt> list when <tt> BOA_init</tt> returns. Other
parameters in <tt> argv</tt> will remain. The supported options are:
<P>
<DL ><DT>-BOAiiop_port <tt> &lt;port number (0-65535)&gt;</tt>
<DD> Use the port number to receive
IIOP requests. This option can be specified multiple times in the command
line and the BOA would be initialised to listen on all of the ports.
<P>
<DT>-BOAid <tt> &lt;id (string)&gt;</tt>
<DD> If this option is used the id must be
``omniORB2_BOA''.
<P>
<DT>-BOAiiop_name_port <tt> &lt;hostname[:port number]&gt;</tt>
<DD> Similar to <tt>
-BOAiiop_port</tt>, this options tells the BOA the hostname and optionally the port number to use.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
If the third argument of <tt> BOA_init</tt> is non-nil, it must be the string
constant ``omniORB2_BOA''. If the argument is nil, -BOAid must be present
in <tt> argv</tt>.
<P>
If there is any problem in the initialisation process, a <tt>
CORBA::INITIALIZE</tt> exception would be raised.
<P>
To register an object with the BOA, the method
<tt> _obj_is_ready</tt> should be called with the return value of <tt>
BOA_init</tt> as the argument.
<P>
<tt> BOA_init</tt> is thread-safe. It can be called multiple times and the
same <tt> BOA_ptr</tt> will be returned. However, only the <tt> argv</tt> in the
first call will be scanned, the argument is ignored in subsequent calls.
<P>
<tt> BOA_init</tt> returns a pseudo object of type <tt>
CORBA::BOA_ptr</tt>. Similar to <tt> CORBA::Object_ptr</tt>, the pointer can be
managed using <tt> CORBA::BOA_var</tt>, <tt> BOA::_duplicate</tt> and <tt>
CORBA::release</tt>. The pointer can be tested using <tt> CORBA::is_nil</tt> which
returns true if the pointer is equivalent to the return value of <tt>
BOA::_nil</tt>.
<P>
After <tt> BOA_init</tt> is called, objects can be registered. However,
incoming IIOP requests would not be despatched until <tt> impl_is_ready</tt>
is called.
<P>

<PRE>class BOA {
public:
   impl_is_ready(CORBA::ImplementationDef_ptr p = 0,
                 CORBA::Boolean NonBlocking = 0);
};
</PRE>

<P>
One of the common pitfall in using the BOA is to forget to call
impl_is_ready. Until this call returns, there is no thread listening on
the port from which IIOP requests are received. The remote client may hang
because of this.
<P>
When <tt> impl_is_ready</tt> is called with no argument. The calling thread
would be blocked indefinitely in the function until <tt> impl_shutdown</tt>
(see below) is called. The thread that is calling <tt> impl_is_ready</tt>
is not used by the BOA to perform its internal functions. The BOA has its
own set of threads to process incoming requests and general
housekeeping. Therefore, it is not necessary to have a thread blocked in
the call if it can be put into use elsewhere. For example, the main thread
may call <tt> impl_is_ready</tt> once in non-blocking mode (see below) and
then enter the event loop to handle the GUI frontend.
<P>
If non-blocking behaviour is needed, the <tt> NonBlocking</tt> argument should be
set to 1. For instance, if you creates a callback object, you might call
impl_is_ready in non-blocking mode to tell the BOA to start receiving
IIOP requests before sending the callback object to the remote object. The
first argument <tt> ImplementationDef_ptr</tt> is ignored by the BOA. Just set
the argument to nil.
<P>
<tt> impl_is_ready</tt> is thread safe and can be called multiple
times. Multiple threads can be blocked in <tt> impl_is_ready</tt>.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION00620000000000000000> Object Registration</A></H1>
<P>
Once the BOA is initialised, objects can be registered. The
purpose of object registration is to let the BOA know of the existence of
the object and to dispatch requests for the object as upcalls into the
object.
<P>
To register an object, the <tt> _obj_is_ready</tt> function should be
called. <tt> _obj_is_ready</tt> is a member function of the implementation
skeleton class. The function should be called only once for each object.
The call should be made only after the object is fully initialised.
<P>
The member function <tt> obj_is_ready</tt> of the BOA may also be used to
register an object. However, this function has been superseded by <tt>
_obj_is_ready</tt> and should not be used in new application code.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION00630000000000000000> Object Disposal</A></H1>
<P>
Once an object is registered, it is under the
management of the BOA. To remove the object from the BOA and to delete it
(when it is safe to do so), the <tt> _dispose</tt> function should be called.
<tt> _dispose</tt> is a member function of the implementation skeleton class.
The function should be called only once for each object.
<P>
Notice the asymmetry in object instantiation and destruction. To instantiate
an object, the application code has to call the <b> new</b>
operator. To remove the object, the application should never
call the delete operator on the object directly.
<P>
At the time the <tt> _dispose</tt> call is made, there may be other threads
invoking on the object, the BOA ensures that all these calls are completed
before removing the object from its internal tables and calling the
<b> delete</b> operator.
<P>
Internally, the BOA keeps a reference count on each object. Initially, the
reference count is 0. After a call to <tt> _obj_is_ready</tt>, the reference
count is 1. The BOA increases the reference count by 1 before
an upcall into the object is made. The count is decreased by 1 when the
upcall returns.  <tt> _dispose</tt> decreases the reference count by 1, if
the reference count is 0, the delete operator is called. If the count is
non-zero, the object is marked as disposed. The object will be deleted when
the reference count eventually goes to zero.
<P>
The reference count is also increased by 1 for each object reference held
in the same address space. Hence, the <b> delete</b> operator will not be
called when there are outstanding object references in the same address
space. To ensure that an object is deleted, all its object references in
the same address space should be released using <tt> CORBA::release</tt>.
<P>
Unlike colocated object references, references held by clients in other
address spaces would not prevent the deletion of objects. If these clients
invoke on the object after it is disposed, the system exception INV_OBJREF
would be raised. The difference in semantics is an undesirable side-effect
of the current BOA implementation. In future, colocated references will
have the same semantics as remote references, i.e. their presence will not
delay the deletion of the objects.
<P>
Instead of <tt> _dispose</tt>, it may be useful to have a method to deactivate
the object but not deleting it. This feature is not supported in the
current BOA implementation.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION00640000000000000000> BOA Shutdown</A></H1>
<P>
The BOA can be withdrawn from service using member functions <tt>
impl_shutdown</tt> and <tt> destroy</tt>.
<P>

<PRE>class BOA {
public:
   void impl_shutdown();
   void destroy();
};
</PRE>

<P>
<tt> impl_shutdown</tt> and <tt> destroy</tt> are the inverse of <tt>
impl_is_ready</tt> and <tt> BOA_init</tt> respectively.
<P>
<tt> impl_shutdown</tt> deactivates the BOA. When the call returns, all the
internal threads and network connections will be shutdown. Any thread
blocking in <tt> impl_is_ready</tt> would be unblocked. After the call, no
request from other address spaces will be processed. In other words, the
BOA will be in the same state as it was in before <tt> impl_is_ready</tt> was
called. For example, a remote client may hang if it tries to connect to the
server after <tt> impl_shutdown</tt> was called because no thread is listening
on the IIOP port.
<P>
<tt> impl_shutdown</tt> does not wait for incoming requests to complete before
it closes the network connections. The remote clients will see the network
connections shutdown and the replies may not  reach them even if the
upcalls have been completed. Therefore, if the application is to define an
operation in an IDL interface to shutdown the BOA,  the operation should be
defined as an oneway operation.
<P>
<tt> impl_shutdown</tt> is thread-safe and can be called multiple times. The
call is silently ignored if the BOA has already been shutdown. After <tt>
impl_shutdown</tt> is called, the BOA can be reactivated by another call to
<tt> impl_is_ready</tt>.
<P>
It should be noted that <tt> impl_shutdown</tt> does not affect outgoing
network connections. That is, clients in the same address space will
still be able to make calls to objects in other address spaces.
<P>
While remote requests are not delivered after <tt> impl_shutdown</tt> is
called, the current implementation does not stop colocated clients from
calling the objects. In future, colocated clients will exhibit the same
behaviour as remote clients.
<P>
<tt> destroy</tt> permanently removed the BOA. This function will call <tt>
impl_shutdown</tt> implicitly if it has not been called. When this call
returns, the IIOP port(s) held by the BOA will be freed. Remote clients
will see their requests refused by the operating system when they try to
open a connection to the IIOP port(s).
<P>
After <tt> destroy</tt> is called, the BOA should not be used. If there is any
objects still registered with the BOA, the objects should not be invoked
afterwards. The objects are not disposed. Invoking on the objects after
<tt> destroy</tt> would result in undefined behaviour. Initialisation of
another BOA using <tt> BOA_init</tt> is not supported. The behaviour of <tt>
BOA_init</tt> after this call is undefined.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION00650000000000000000> Unsupported functions</A></H1>
<P>
The following member functions are not implemented. Calling these functions
do not have any effect.
<P>
<UL><LI> <tt> Object_ptr create(...)</tt>
<LI> <tt> ReferenceData* get_id(Object_ptr)</tt>
<LI> <tt> Principal_ptr get_principal(Object_ptr,Environment_ptr)</tt>
<LI> <tt> void change_implementation(Object_ptr, ImplementationDef_ptr)</tt>
<LI> <tt> void deactivate_impl(ImplementationDef_ptr)</tt>
<LI> <tt> void deactivate_obj(Object_ptr)</tt>
</UL><H1><A NAME=SECTION00660000000000000000> Loading Objects On Demand</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME=load_on_demand>&#160;</A>
<P>
Since 2.5.0, there is limited support for loading objects on demand. 
An application can register a handler for loading objects dynamically. The
handler should have the signature <tt> omniORB::loader::mapKeyToObject_t</tt>:
<P>

<PRE>  namespace omniORB {
    ...
    class loader {
    public:
      typedef CORBA::Object_ptr (*mapKeyToObject_t) (const objectKey&amp; key);
      static void set(mapKeyToObject_t NewKeyToObject);
    };
  };
</PRE>

<P>
When the ORB cannot locate the target object in this address space, it
calls the handler with the object key of the target. The handler is expected
to instantiate the object, either in this address space or in another
address space, and returns the object reference to the newly instantiated
object. The ORB will then reply with a LOCATION_FORWARD message to instruct
the client to retry using the object reference returned by the handler.
When the handler returns, the ORB assumes ownership of the returned
value. It will call CORBA::release() on the returned value when it has
finished with it.
<P>
The handler may be called concurrently by multi-threads. Hence it  
must be thread-safe.
<P>
If the handler cannot load the target object, it should return     
CORBA::Object::_nil(). The object will be treated as non-existing.
<P>
The application registers the handler with the ORB at runtime      
using omniORB::loader::set(). This function is not thread-safe.    
Calling this function again will replace the old handler with      
the new one.
