<P>
The OMNI thread abstraction is designed to provide a common set of thread
operations for use in programs written in C++.  Programs written using the
abstraction should be much easier to port between different architectures with
different underlying threads primitives.
<P>
The programming interface is designed to be similar to the C language interface
to POSIX threads (IEEE draft standard 1003.1c - previously 1003.4a, often known
as ``pthreads'' [<A HREF="node6.html#pthreads">POSIX94</A>]).
<P>
Much of the abstraction consists of simple C++ object wrappers around pthread
calls.  However for some features such as thread-specific data, a better
interface can be offered because of the use of C++.
<P>
Some of the more complex features of pthreads are not supported because of the
difficulty of ensuring the same features can be offered on top of other thread
systems.  Such features include thread cancellation and complex scheduling
control (though simple thread priorities are supported).
<P>
The abstraction layer is currently implemented for the following architectures
/ thread systems:
<P>
<UL><LI> Solaris 2.x using pthreads draft 10
<LI> Solaris 2.x using solaris threads (but pthreads version is now standard)
<LI> Alpha OSF1 using pthreads draft 4
<LI> Windows NT using NT threads
<LI> Linux 2.x using Linuxthread 0.5 (which is based on pthreads draft 10)
<LI> Linux 2.x using MIT pthreads (which is based on draft 8)
<LI> ATMos using pthreads draft 6
<P>
</UL>
<P>
See the <tt> omnithread.h</tt> header file for full details of the API.  The
descriptions below assume you have some previous knowledge of threads, mutexes,
condition variables and semaphores.  Also refer to other documentation
([<A HREF="node6.html#birrell">Birrell89</A>], [<A HREF="node6.html#pthreads">POSIX94</A>]) for further explanation of these ideas
(particularly condition variables, the use of which may not be particularly
intuitive when first encountered).
