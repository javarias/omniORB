The OMNI Naming Service (<EM>omniNames</EM>) is an omniORB
implementation of the OMG's COS Naming Service Specification. It
offers a way for a client to turn a human-readable name into an object
reference, on which the client can subsequently invoke operations in
the normal way. See the OMG specification for full details of the
functionality provided by the Naming Service.<BR>
<BR>
The Naming Service stores a set of bindings of names to objects.
These bindings can be arranged as an arbitrary directed graph,
although they are often arranged in a tree hierarchy. Each node in
the graph is a <EM>naming context</EM>. There is a &#8220;root&#8221; context at
which name lookups usually start. This is the object returned by the
call to <CODE>CORBA::ORB::resolve_initial_references("NameService").</CODE><BR>

The Naming Service is often part of the bootstrapping process of other
CORBA programs. For this reason, if an instance of omniNames crashes
(or the machine on which it runs is rebooted), it is important that
certain aspects of its operation persist upon restarting. Firstly the
root context of the Naming Service should always be accessible through
the same object reference. This helps the ORB to implement the
<CODE>resolve_initial_references</CODE> call by allowing the object
reference to be stored in a configuration file, for example.
Secondly, the naming graph with all its bindings should persist
between invocations.<BR>
<BR>
To achieve this, omniNames generates a log file, to which it writes
out an entry every time a change is made to the naming graph. The
directory in which this log file is written can be specified with the
<CODE>OMNINAMES_LOGDIR</CODE> environment variable. When omniNames is
restarted it uses the log file so that it can regenerate the naming
graph.<BR>
<BR>
Periodically the log file is checkpointed, removing unnecessary
entries from the log file. The idle time between checkpoints can be
set with the <CODE>OMNINAMES_ITBC</CODE> environment variable. It defaults
to 15 minutes.<BR>

<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc3">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting omniNames and setting omniORB.cfg</H2><!--SEC END -->

When starting omniNames for the first time, you can either let it
start with the default TCP port of 2809, or you can specify the port
number on which it should listen. This is written to the log file so
that on subsequent invocations it will listen on the same port number
and thus can be accessible through the same object reference. When
omniNames starts up successfully it writes the stringified object
reference for its root context on standard error.<BR>
<BR>
At startup, omniORB tries to read the configuration file
<CODE>omniORB.cfg</CODE> to obtain the object reference to the root context
of the Naming Service. This object reference is returned by
<CODE>resolve_initial_references("NameService")</CODE>. There are a number
of methods of specifying the root naming context in
<CODE>omniORB.cfg</CODE>&mdash;see the omniORB manual for details.<BR>
