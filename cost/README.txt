CORBA Open Source Testing
=========================

This source tree contains several test suites for CORBA
implementations in C++ and Java. The code originally came from the
OMG's CORBA Open Source Testing project, which lived at
cost.omg.org. That site no longer exists.

All the contributing companies agreed to release their tests under the
terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License, available in the file
COPYING.LIB.
