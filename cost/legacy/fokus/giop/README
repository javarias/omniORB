A TTCN-3 based Test Suite for CORBA GIOP/IIOP
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This TTCN-3 based test suite can be used to test the
conformance of parts of a server-side ORB implementation
The test suite has been used with the Java implementation
of orbacus under Linux and Solaris.

Settings
=========

Edit the Make.rules file to set some variables.

You need some Java jar files for the compilation and execution of the
test suite.
Download the files from http://www.testingtech.com and put them in the
$TTTHREELIBDIR.
(TTthreeCompiler.jar, TTthreeRuntime.jar, tools.jar and also antlr.jar,
xerces.jar, and xml.jar)

NOTE: Generated Java Code of the TTCN-3 ATS has been added to the
'src/generated_ets' directory. It will be compiled and you only need
the TTthreeRuntime.jar from TestingTechnologies and xerces.jar.
If you have modified the ATS and need to (re)compile
this version you have to modify the Makefile.


Compilation and Installation
=============================

Type:

1.) make
2.) make Workdir/ExecuteTest

Run the Tests
==============

1.) cd Workdir

2.) ./ExecuteTest giop.mlf

3.) e.g. to run all test cases type 'm'. To run a single test case
    type 'r 1', 'r 2', ... .


You don't need the scripts 'corba_server.sh' and 'corba_client.sh' in
Workdir to run the tests. But if you want to use them you have
to adapt them to your environment.
