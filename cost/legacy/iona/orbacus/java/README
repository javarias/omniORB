1. Setting up

Note that JDK 1.3 or newer is required to run these tests. You have to
ensure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the location of
your JDK and that your ORB's classes are included in CLASSPATH *before*
any classes of the JDK's internal ORB. (Unless you want to run tests
against Sun's ORB.)
In order to configure the tests you have to create a file config/Make.rules
that reflects your system configuration. For some ORBs templates are
provided that should help setting everything up. These files are located
in the config folder. Just copy one of them to config/Make.rules if you
have one of these ORBs and then edit this file to reflect your setup.

2. Optional tests

For ORBs that do not support the optional Fixed data type use
-DHAVE_NO_FIXED_TYPE when compiling the IDL.
For ORBs that do not support valuetypes use -DHAVE_NO_VALUETYPE
when compiling the IDL and the generated code.
For ORBs that do not support CORBA 2.4 use -DHAVE_NO_CORBA_2_4
when compiling the IDL.

3. Compiling the sources

Type 'make' in the top level tree.

4. Running the tests

Each folder provides a runtest shell script that starts the servers and
clients used for each test. You can run all the tests by starting the runtest
script in the toplevel folder.
