1. Setting up

In order to configure the tests you have to create a file config/Make.rules
that reflects your system configuration. For ORBacus, Mico, omniorb and
Orbix2000 templates are provided that should help setting everything up.
These files are located in the config folder. Just copy one of them to
config/Make.rules if you have one of these ORBs and then edit this file to
reflect your setup.
Additionally for other ORBs than those listed above you should edit
include/includes.h to reflect the vendor-specific files that have to be
included.

2. Optional tests

For ORBs that do not support the optional Fixed data type use
-DHAVE_NO_FIXED_TYPE when compiling the IDL and the generated code.
For ORBs that do not support the optional long double data type use
-DHAVE_NO_LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE when compiling the IDL and the generated code.
For ORBs that do not support CORBA 2.4 use -DHAVE_NO_CORBA_2_4
when compiling the IDL and the generated code.

3. Compiling the sources

Type 'make' in the top level tree.

4. Running the tests

Currently each folder contains an executable client or a client server
combination. First the server has to be started, then the client. Scripts
that automatically start the tests will be provided later.
