Shutdown Test
=============

This tests verifies the ORB's graceful shutdown in several scenarios.
The test is a modification of the standard account example. The test
consists of the following programs:

1. account_client: This is the standard account client that binds to
an account server and queries the balance using the method balance().
The difference, though, is that it queries the server for balance()
 in an infinite loop. 

2. account_server: This is the standard account server implementing 
the balance() method. in addition, this server also implements a
shutdown() method. The shutdown method calls 
	(a) CORBA::ORB::shutdown() or 
	(b) a combination of BOA::deactivate_obj() followed by 
	    a CORBA::release( obj ). 

The shutdown() method takes a Boolean variable as an argument and 
chooses between (a) and (b). 

3. shutdown: This program binds to the account server and invokes the 
shutdown() method implemented by the server. By passing a command line
argument to this program (either 1 or 0), you will be able to shutdown
the server in one of two ways, describd above. 

Scenarios
=========

1. Start an osagent if one is not running yet. 
   Start several account_clients. (atleast 4 or 5).  
   Start one account_server on the command prompt (both UNIX/Windows).
   Watch the clients making progress. 
   Kill the account_server explicitly by typing "control-C".
   Watch the clients catching CORBA::NO_IMPLEMENT exceptions.
   Start another account_server. 
   Make sure the account_clients rebind to the newly started 
   account_server and continue to make progress. 
   Make sure none of the account_clients hang or crash.

2. Repeat scenario 1. 
   Instead of typing "control-C" to kill the account_server, use the 
   task manager on Windows to kill the account_server. 
   Make sure none of the account_clients hang or crash.

3. Repeat Scenario 1.
   Instead of killing the account_server manually, start the shutdown 
   client program in another window/terminal and specify no argument
   on the command line.
   Make sure none of the account_clients hang or crash.

4. Repeat Scenario 1.
   Instead of killing the account_server manually, start the shutdown
   client program in another window/terminal and specify the command
   line argument 1.
   Make sure none of the account_clients hang or crash.

5. Start an osagent if one is not running yet. 
   Start two account_servers. 
   Start several account_clients (atleast 4 or 5).
   Watch the clients making progress. 
   Kill one of the two account_servers started by explicitly typing "control-C".
   Watch the clients failover and bind to the other account_server started
   earlier.
   Make sure none of the account_clients hang or crash.
    
6. Repeat Scenario 5.
   Instead of starting both the account_servers on the same machine, 
   Start the second account_server on a different machine. 
   Make sure none of the account_clients hang or crash.

7. Repeat all of the above Scenarios with command line arguments to the
   account_server: -OAlocalipc 0 etc. 
   Make sure none of the account_clients hang or crash.

8. Make sure you run the shutdown test with the single threaded server
   as well.
