Bank Servant Activator for C++</H2>

<BR>IDL interface for the <B>Bank</B>.
<LI>
<A HREF="BankImpl.h">BankImpl.h</A></LI>

<BR>Implements the following classes
<BR><B>AccountRegistry</B> : Stores a name-value pair of name and account
information and provides synchronized access.
<BR><B>AccountImpl </B>: stores a balance for each account
<BR>The <B>AccountManagerImpl</B> servant implements <TT>open()</TT> method
which opens an account if necessary with a random balance or returns the
account if one exists by using the account registry. It also implements
a helper function called <I>open_account()</I> to append the checking or
savings flag info to the name to make it unique.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<BR>Bank server. This file contains the server implementations of&nbsp;
Account Manager Servant Activator. The <TT>main()</TT> function&nbsp; creates
a child POA named bank_servant_activator_poa with USE_SERVANT_MANAGER as
request processing policy and creates and registers the AccountManager
Activator as the ServantActivator for the POA. It then creates two references
one for checking account type and another for savings account and writes
it out to "cref.dat" and "sref.dat" and waits for client requests.
<BR>The ServantActivator for Account Manager servant( <B>AccountManagerActivator</B>
) creates and returns a servant ( <B>AccountManager</B> ) every time the
<TT>incarnate()</TT> method is invoked by the POA. This servant gets deleted
when the POA calls etherealize() , which in this case gets called when
deactivate_object() is called on the POA by a DeActivator thread. The servant
could be a SavingsAccountManagerImpl or CheckingAccountManagerImpl based
on the object id passed to incarnate() method. After the servant is created
the incarnate() method creates the deactivator thread.Note that <TT>etherealize()</TT>
is also invoked when the POA is destroyed.
<BR>The <B>DeActivatorThread</B> class implements the <TT>begin()</TT>
method that deactivates the servant created in <TT>AccountManagerActivator::incarnate()</TT>
method after approximately 15 seconds.
<BR>The <B>SavingsAccountManager&nbsp; </B>servant calls AccountManager's
<I>open_account()</I> with the name and a Savings related flag and returns
the result.
<BR>The<B> CheckingAccountManager&nbsp; </B>servant calls AccountManager's
<I>open_account()</I> with the name and a Checking account&nbsp; related
flag and returns the result.
<BR>Note that we create a servant per object in our example.
<LI>
<A HREF="Client.C">Client.C</A></LI>

<BR>This is the Bank client. It binds to the <B>AccountManager</B> object
using the reference from either "cref.dat" or 'sref.dat" based on user
input and invokes <TT>open()</TT> to open a bank account. It then invokes
<TT>balance()</TT> on the <B>Account</B> object reference obtained to query
the balance.

<A HREF="Makefile.cpp">Makefile.cpp</A> (Makefile.cpp <I>on Windows</I>):

<H3>
Building this example</H3>
Typing <B>make cpp</B> (or <B>nmake -f Makefile.cpp</B> <I>on Windows</I>)
in the servant_activator subdirectory will cause the <A HREF="Bank.idl">Bank.idl</A>
to be run through the idl2cpp compiler. It will also build the following
executables for the examples described above:
<UL>
<LI>
Server (Server.exe <I>on Windows</I>)</LI>

<LI>
Client (Client.exe <I>on Windows</I>)</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Running this example</H3>
To run the examples, first make sure that the VisiBroker Smart Agent (osagent
executable) is running on your network. Then start the bank server using
the command:
<UL>
<PRE><TT><B>prompt></B> Server&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp;
(start Server <I>on Windows</I>)
<I>// make the server run in the background</I></TT></PRE>
</UL>
Next, open a user's bank account and query the balance in the account using
the command
<UL>
<PRE><TT><B>prompt></B>Client john checking</TT></PRE>
</UL>

<UL>or</UL>

<UL>
<PRE><TT><B>prompt></B>Client&nbsp; john savings&nbsp;
<I>// uses a default name</I></TT></PRE>

<PRE><I><TT>or</TT></I></PRE>

<PRE><TT><B>prompt></B>Client&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>// uses a default name and creates a checking account</I></TT></PRE>
</UL>
From the server output, you will see that the servant activator's <TT>incarnate()</TT>
method is invoked for the first client request. If you invoke the client
again within 15 seconds you will see that the <TT>incarnate()</TT> method
is not called . This is because the servant is already active and is in
the active object map of the POA. If you wait for 15 seconds you should
see, from the server output, a message generated by the DeActivator thread
when it called <TT>deactivate_object()</TT>. This will remove the servant
from the Active Object Map and invoke <TT>etherealize()</TT> to clean up
any servant resources. Now if you invoke the client again the <TT>incarnate()</TT>
method gets called to recreate a servant. You can also see that the incarnate
method is called
<BR>for two different types of accounts ( checking and savings ) and the
same user can hold 2 different accounts.
