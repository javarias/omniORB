Xtypes test:
-----------
This test tests extended IDL types such as longlong, unsigned long long etc.
If you are running this test between a Windows Client/ UNIX server or
Windows Server/ UNIX client, then on UNIX, use 
	make XTRA_FLAGS=-DNO_LONG_DOUBLE all
This is because Windows does not support the longdouble type.
