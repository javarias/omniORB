<H2> Bank Servant Locator</H2>
<p>This example has a two simple interfaces to open either a Checking Account or Savings Account
   and to query the balance in that account. Instead of creating a servant 
  and waiting for requests, this example manufactures a SavingsAccountManager and
  CheckingAccountManager object reference, writes it out to files named &quot;cref.dat&quot;
  and &quot;sref.dat&quot; and starts waiting for requests. Example sets up a servant locator 
  on the POA. The AccountManager servant is created only when the request is made. 
  Since servant locator is being  used instead of servant activator, 
  the created servant will be used only for  this request. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This scenario of activating the servants only on demand is very useful in Servers 
  which serve a large number of objects. Object references for these large number 
  of objects can be manufactured and advertised without bringing the corresponding 
  servants to life. When a request comes on a particular object reference, POA 
  realizes that the servant is not in memory, invokes the servant locator set 
  for that POA which can load the object state from a database and bring the object 
  to life. </p>

  <LI> To use the right policies on POA creation so it can use servant manager 
    to process requests</LI>
  <LI> To write a servant locator</LI>
  <LI>To set the servant manager on the POA</LI>
  <LI>To create a reference with servant backing up that reference</LI>
