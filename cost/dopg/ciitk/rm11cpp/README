CORBA/IIOP Interoperability Test Kit

Distributed Object Promotion Group
(NEC Corporation developed this test kit. Copyrighted (c) 2000)
15th April 2000

This test kit is designed to provide the functionality to test the 
interoperability specified by the Object Management Group's CORBA/IIOP
specification version two (or later versions). All of the programs 
included in the test kit are available as open sources based on the 
BSD style copyright as above.

[TEST CATEGORY]

rm: request-reply invocation / minimum / v1.1

Please review ``TEST CATEGORY AT A GLANCE'' section below to check 
available operator names in this test category.

[ENVIRONMENT]

This test kit includes one IDL file and four source programs, and they
have to be compiled using your CORBA IDL compiler and C++/Java 
compilers in your environment respectively.

[FILES]

The files contained are:

    README		this file
    dopgirm11.idl	CORBA IDL definition file
    rm11Client.cpp	client main program
    rm11Caller.cpp	program with procedures calling a server object
    rm11Server.cpp	server main program
    rm11Servant.cpp	program with server object implementation
    cl_vendor.h		vendor specific header for client (not copyrighted)
    sv_vendor.h		vendor specific header for server (not copyrighted)

[HOW TO RUN]

1. Set up your CORBA runtime environment

2. Execute the server program
   Just one argument IOR, which is a file name for storing server's 
   object reference, is required.
   
   > server.exe	IOR
   Server is now ready.

   Now server is running and waiting for client requests.

3. Execute the client program
   One or more argument is acceptable. The first argument should be 
   the IOR file name specified and created by the server execution.
   Rest of the arguments are operation names defined in the IDL file.
   Please note that Providing no operation names means providing all 
   of the operations.

   > client IOR op1 op2		... `op1' and `op2' are invoked in turn.
   > client IOR			... all operations are invoked in turn.
   
4. Monitor the client-server invocation progress
   Both client and server programs generate operation names in turn 
   and synchronously, or some messages if errors occur.

[BUGS, COMMENTS, SUGGESTIONS]

If you find any problems or bugs in the test kit, please let us know. 
Any suggestions or feedbacks are also welcome.
