CORBA/IIOP Interoperability Test Kit

Distributed Object Promotion Group
(NEC Corporation developed this test kit. Copyrighted (c) 2000)
17th Aug 2000

This test kit is designed to provide the functionality to test the 
interoperability specified by the Object Management Group's CORBA/IIOP
specification version two (or later versions). All of the programs 
included in the test kit are available as open sources based on the 
BSD style copyright as above.

[TEST CATEGORY]

nx: interoperable naming service / -- / v1.1

Please review ``TEST CATEGORY AT A GLANCE'' section below to check 
available operator names in this test category.

[ENVIRONMENT]

This test kit includes two source programs. They have to be 
compiled separately using your Java compiler in your environment.

[FILES]

The files contained are:

    README		this file
    Prepare.java	naming server initialization
    nx11Client.java	client main and operations

[HOW TO RUN]

1. Set up your CORBA runtime environment

2. Execute a naming server
   (It depends on each CORBA product)

3. Initialize the naming server
   It is necessary to initialize the naming contexts in your naming
   server prior to executing the client program below. Prepare class
   can recognize your naming server in a default manner in your CORBA
   environment.

   > java Prepare

4. Execute the client program
   Two or more arguments are acceptable. The first and the second 
   arguments are host name and port number of the naming service 
   invoked in step 2. Rest of the arguments should be test item names 
   specified in `the test category at a glance' below. Please note 
   that providing no test item names means providing all of the test 
   items.

   > java nx11Client namesvhost namesvport ins1 ins2
				... `ins1' and `ins2' are invoked in turn.
   > java nx11Client namesvhost namesvport
				... all test operations are invoked in turn.

5. Monitor the client invocation progress
   Client programs generate operation names in turn, or some messages
   if errors occur.

[BUGS, COMMENTS, SUGGESTIONS]

If you find any problems or bugs in the test kit, please let us know. 
Any suggestions or feedbacks are also welcome.
Please e-mail to iioprequest@dopg.gr.jp.
